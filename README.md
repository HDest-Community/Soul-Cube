### Important
---
- This mod requires [AceCoreLib](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/acecorelib).

### Notes
---
- Loadout code is `slc`.
- Configuration codes are:
	- `frag`: Starting frag.
	- `level`: Starting level.
- Type `SC_ReturnToOwner` in the console to force the cube to return to you if you are within sight.

### How it works
---
- Double-tap Use to pick up a floating cube.
- The cube passively collects frag only while it's in your inventory.
- It needs at least 5 frag to become active.
- Max frag capacity is 20 + 5 for each extra level.
- Max level is 4. Cube starts at level 0.
- Level is increased by gaining experience. Experience is gained by using the cube.
- Each level increases damage and rate of fire.
- Frag collection frequency increases with level. Range does not.
- Attacks up to 3 enemies at once, dealing a flat amount of damage and ignoring shields/armor. Each attack costs 1 frag.
- Each attack recharges all nearby visible players' highest non-full battery.
- 20 frag can be expended at L1+ to grant the player spiritual armor. At L1, you can only grant 1 layer. Up to 3 layers at L3.

##### While it is out, it has these passive effects:
- Helps put out fire faster.
- [L1+] Helps with incap.
- [L1+] Speeds up regeneration if you have blues.
- Compels pained archviles to show up sooner.
