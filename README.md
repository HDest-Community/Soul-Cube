### Notes
---
- Soul cubes are found naturally in the world. Can also drop from [weapon crates](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/weapon-crate).
- Loadout code is `slc`.

### How it works
---
- The cube passively collects frag only while it's in your inventory.
- It needs at least 5 frag to become active.
- Max frag capacity is 20 + 5 for each extra level.
- Max level is 4. Cube starts at level 0.
- Each level increased damage and rate of fire.
- It can attack up to 3 enemies at once, dealing a flat amount of damage and ignoring shields/armor. Each attack costs 1 frag.
- Each attack recharges all nearby players' highest non-full battery OR gives all of them a little bit of blues.
- 20 frag can be expended at L1+ to grant the player spiritual armour. At L1, you can only grant 1 layer. Up to 3 layers at L3.
- Helps put out fire faster if out.
- Can collect brass and [universal reloader](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/universal-reloader) materials.
- To pick up the cube while it's active, double-tap Use on it.
